    <h3>Description</h3>
    
    <p>This is my favorite "one-pot" recipe, that just makes sense and is so easy and quick to do. You will need some high-fat <em>Quark</em>, a traditional dairy product in Slavic speaking countries.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>fusilli pasta (it looks like a screw, in Slovak language: <i>Sruby</i>)</li>
        <li>200 grams of quark</li>
        <li>60 grams of bacon</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>salt</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the pasta in salted boild water, follow the instructions on the package.</li>
        <li>While cooking, cut onion and bacon to small pieces.</li>
        <li>Once pasta is cooked, leave it in colander.</li>
        <li>In the same pot on low heat, add olive oil and onion, stir well. Once it catches a bit of color, throw in the bacon.</li>
        <li>Once browned a little, turn off the heat, put in the cooked pasta and stir everything thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Finally, crumble the quark onto the pasta and stir again.</li>
    </ol>
