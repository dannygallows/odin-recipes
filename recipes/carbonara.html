    <h3>Description</h3>
    
    <p>My girlfriend loves this dish, it flatters me a bit to be honest. I will teach you have to make this Italian-cuisine classic like a <b>pro</b>.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>250 grams of Spaghetti</li>
        <li>Pecorino Romano cheese (I like to use Parmigiano. I know, heresy.)</li>
        <li>Guanciale (A generous slice for one portion, in this case two slices.)</li>
        <li>4 eggs - preferably from a good source, as they will not be thoroughly cooked. However, I never had a problem with the classic store-bought ones.</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the spaghetti in boiled salted water. If you are doing this for the first time, I recommend first preparing everything else.</li>
        <li>While cooking, cut up the guanciale and throw on the pan. Medium heat. Cook until itÂ´s crunchy.</li>
        <li>Crack the eggs open into a bowl, add shredded Pecorino cheese (generous amount) and black pepper (careful with that). Stir until you have a creamy sauce.</li>
        <li>Remove the guanciale from the pan, leaving only its oil. Throw the cooked spaghetti on the pan on the lowest heat.</li>
        <li>Now, turn off the heat and pour the egg cream over the spaghetti. The remaining heat from the pan and spaghetti should make it into a nice substance, not scrambled eggs.</li>
        <li>Stir well, add the guanciale on top and you are done.</li>
    </ol>
